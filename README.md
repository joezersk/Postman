# Postman
Repo for my various Postman scripts so I can share with others

Postman Collections:
<HR>
<B>Collection #1:  REGISTER ACI Nodes</B>
<BR>
  -This is collection does two things.  One, it logs into APIC (assumes you have not yet done so).  Second, it will register a series of nodes, based on serial number, and sets node name and node number.  Note that each environment is unique, so change the values in the body of the POST to your own values.
